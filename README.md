# Simple Login Interface - Android Studio Project

This project is a basic Android Studio app developed using Java. It demonstrates a simple login interface with basic functionality, including navigation between different screens. The project focuses primarily on the frontend aspect, without any specific architecture or backend integration.

## Features

- **Login Interface**: Users can log in by entering a hardcoded username and password.
- **Username**: `test`
- **Password**: `test`
- **Save Password**: The app allows users to save their login credentials.
- **Navigation**: After logging in, users can navigate between three blank screens.

## No Backend or APIs

This project does not include backend functionality or API integration. It is strictly a frontend demonstration aimed at practicing UI creation and navigation in Android Studio. Since there is no backend, the username and password are hardcoded directly into the app.

## Purpose of the Project

The main goals of this project are:

- **Practice UI design**: Create a simple login interface using Android Studio and Java.
- **Test Navigation**: Explore the basics of screen-to-screen navigation within the app.
- **No Specific Architecture**: This project does not follow a specific architecture such as MVVM or MVP, as the focus is on the frontend.

## How to Use

1. Enter the hardcoded credentials: 
   - Username: `test`
   - Password: `test`
2. Upon successful login, you can navigate between the three blank screens using the app's basic navigation system.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an example of frontend development in Android Studio. It allows developers to get hands-on experience with UI elements, navigation, and login interfaces without dealing with backend complexity.
